# Discourse Assessments

These assessments have been used in past research studies on speech output abilities after stroke. They are designed to engage participants in fluent speech production rather than simply naming or repeating.

### Making a PBJ

The participant is shown an image of a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich and is asked to describe how they would make the sandwich in a step by step manner.

### Picnic Scene Description

The picnic scene is from the Western Aphasia Battery. The participant is asked to describe as many elements in the scene as possible. They may tell a story about what is happening or simply describe the picture in a list-wise manner.  

### Broken Window Description

The broken window description assessment is used to get participants to describe the order of events from one image to the next (there's a set of 4). They should try to tell a story about what has happened to the window.

### Telling the Story of Cinderella

Participants view images from the cinderella storybook and then attempt to narrate the story on their own without the pictures as a guide. The pictures can be "flipped" through by using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard.
